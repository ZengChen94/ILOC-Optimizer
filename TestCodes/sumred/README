sumred

This benchmark implements a small sumreduction
to create opportunities for loop unrolling.

It takes as input a file that contains a dimension k, followed
by the values for (k x k) array. It reads all of those values.
Next, it computes the sum of those values and writes out that 
result.

To check correctness, the file sumred1.d shoud produce the answer 5050.

To run it on the file sumred1.d, if xyz is the path to the ILOC 
simulator, you would type

   xyz  sumred.i -d sumred1.d

The code should print out a single number (5050 for this file).

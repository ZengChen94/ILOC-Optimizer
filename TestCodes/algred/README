algred

This benchmark implements a small, simple calculation intended
to create opportunities for loop unrolling.

It takes as input a single integer. It then computes some 
algebraic summation as a function of that integer.  The computation
takes cubic time (O(n^3)) in the size of that integer.

To check correctness, if you give it the input 10, it should
produce as output the number 11010.

To run it, if xyz is the path to the ILOC simulator, you would type

   xyz  algred.i

The simulator should respond with a prompt:

  Enter number:

You enter a number and the code runs.

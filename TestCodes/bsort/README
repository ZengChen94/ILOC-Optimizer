bsort

This simple code implements a bubble sort.
It prints out the sorted list.  (Hence, you 
don't want to run this on a 10,000 number file.) 
 

  bsort.i  -- the code
  bsort1.d -- an input file with 20 numbers in worst case order
  bsort2.d -- an input file with 40 numbers in an average kind of order

To run the code, if 'xyz' is the pathname of the simulator, type

   xyz bsort.i -d bsort1.d

which will invoke bsort() on the input file bsort1.d

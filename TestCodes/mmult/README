mmult

This benchmark implements a matrix-matrix multiply.

It takes as input a dimension for the (square) input matrices.
The dimension must be no larger than 100.

The code generates two identity matrices and multiplies them.

It prints out a single number, indicating whether or not
the matrix-matrix multiple produced the expected answer.

If it prints a zero, then the computation produced the correct answer.
If it prints a one, then the computation produced an incorrect answer. 

  mmult.i  -- the code

If 'xyz' is the path to the simulator, then you can run the code
by typing

  xyz mmult.i

You should see a prompt

  Enter number: 

Enter a number between 1 and 100 and hit carriage return.

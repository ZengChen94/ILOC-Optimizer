fib

This code computes the first n fibonnaci numbers.

It takes a single paramter: n.

It limits n to the range 1 to 47.  (At 48, the ILOC
simulator will produce integer overflows and the results
will begin to alternate between negative and positive 
numbers.)

If the path to the simulator is 'xyz', you can run the code by 
typing

   xzy  fib.i

The simulator will prompt you for a number, which the program
will use and the number of fibonnaci numbers to compute.  If 
you insist on trying input numbers greater than 48, it will 
write a zero and quit.
